# Deep Sea Trawling Plugin
The Deep Sea Trawling plugin is a RuneLite plugin that helps make the Deep Sea Trawling Sailing activity in Old School Runescape easier by helping to track all different kinds of fish shoals and their depths.

**Features:**
- **Shoal paths:** A line is drawn along the exact path that each shoal travels with arrows pointing the direction the shoal is moving. A box is drawn at each shoal stopping point.\

- **Shoal tagging:** Tags each shoal with a coloured square. Colour changes depending on which kind of shoal it is. Colours can be changed in the config.\

- **Depth indicator:** A small indicator attached to each shoal shows what depth the shoal is currently at (Either "<font color="Green">Shallow</font>", "<font color="Orange">Medium</font>" or "<font color="red">Deep</font>"). Highlights your nets <font color="yellow">yellow</font> if the depth is at a different depth to the shoals current depth.\

- **Depth UI highlighting:** Highlights the buttons to raise/lower your trawling nets if they need to be raised/lowered.\

- **Shimmering, glistening and vibrant shoals:** Changes the colours of paths and the tags of the shoals when they become either shimmering, glistening or vibrant. These colours can be changed in the config.\

- **Fish quantity info box:** An info box is displayed on the screen that shows how many fish are currently in your nets. Highlights your nets <font color="red">red</font> when your nets are at full capacity. Text colour can be changed in the config.\

- **Depth change timer:** A box is displayed above each shoal that indicates how much time (in seconds) is left until it both changes depth and continues moving.\

- **Net depth UI text:** A rounded box is drawn over top of the trawling net icon displaying either R, S, M or D (Raised, Shallow, Medium or Deep).\
